# TIPS

## Great, you completed two exercises. Here are some simple programming tips to make the best of the course:

## Be as persistent as you can before looking at hints or the solution. Persistence is gold in programming.

##  Sometimes taking a break is the best thing you can do to solve a problem.

## When getting an error, don't panic, but look closely at the error message. Knowing how to fix errors is as important as knowing to write programs.


## slicing syntax is upper-bound exclusive

## Besides the left-to-right positive indexing system that starts from zero, sequence data types such as lists also have a second indexing system that starts from -1 and decreases by one from right to left. 

## Syntax of list slicing is [start:end:step] . When you don't pass a step, Python assumes the step is 1. [:]  itself means get everything from start to end. So, [::2]  means get everything from start to end at a step of two.

## range()  is a Python built-in function that generates a range of integers. However, range()  creates a Python range object. To get a real list object you need to use the list() function to convert the range object into a list object.
